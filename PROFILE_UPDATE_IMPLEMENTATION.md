# Profile Update Features Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented the profile update features for your healthy nutrition app. The implementation includes image upload functionality and editable profile fields with a clean, user-friendly interface.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Image Upload Component** (`ProfileImageUploader`)
- **Location**: `src/features/client/profile/ui/components/profile-image-uploader.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Click or drag-and-drop to upload profile images
  - Real-time preview of uploaded images
  - File validation (image types only, max 5MB)
  - Visual feedback with loading states and hover effects
  - Automatic upload to server using the `useUpdateAccountMutation`

### 2. **Editable Profile Fields** (`EditableProfileFields`)
- **Location**: `src/features/client/profile/ui/components/editable-profile-fields.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Toggle between view and edit modes
  - Form validation using Zod schema
  - Edit fields: Full Name, Phone Number, Address
  - Save/Cancel functionality with proper error handling
  - Loading states during save operations

### 3. **Profile Update Hook** (`useUpdateProfile`)
- **Location**: `src/features/client/profile/hooks/use-update-profile.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Manages form state and validation
  - Handles profile updates via API
  - Updates Redux store with new user data
  - Toast notifications for success/error states
  - Edit mode management

### 4. **Image Upload Hook** (`useImageUpload`)
- **Location**: `src/features/client/profile/hooks/use-image-upload.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Handles file drop zone functionality
  - Image validation and preview
  - API integration for image uploads
  - Redux store updates for user image
  - Error handling and user feedback

### 5. **Updated Personal Information Component**
- **Location**: `src/features/client/profile/ui/components/personal-information.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Integrated new image uploader in profile header
  - Conditional rendering between view and edit modes
  - Improved layout with better component organization

## User Experience

### Image Upload Flow:
1. User clicks on their profile image or drags a file over it
2. File validation occurs (type and size)
3. Preview shows immediately
4. Image uploads automatically to server
5. Success/error toast notifications
6. Profile image updates in real-time

### Profile Edit Flow:
1. User clicks "Edit Profile" button
2. Form fields become editable with current values pre-filled
3. User can modify Full Name, Phone Number, and Address
4. Form validation provides real-time feedback
5. User can Save or Cancel changes
6. Success notification and return to view mode

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Used:
- ✅ `react-hook-form` + `@hookform/resolvers` - Form management
- ✅ `zod` - Form validation schemas
- ✅ `react-dropzone` - File upload functionality
- ✅ `react-hot-toast` - User notifications
- ✅ Existing UI components (Button, Input, Form, etc.)

### API Integration:
- Uses existing `useUpdateAccountMutation` from `user-services.ts`
- Supports both FormData (for images) and JSON (for profile data)
- Proper error handling and loading states

### State Management:
- Updates Redux store via `updateUser` action
- Maintains consistency between local state and server
- Optimistic updates for better UX

## Design Decisions

### 1. **Separate vs Integrated Edit Mode**
I chose to implement **integrated edit mode** where the form appears in the same location as the view. This provides:
- Better visual continuity
- Less cognitive load for users
- Cleaner interface without modal overlays

### 2. **Image Upload Approach**
The image upload is **immediate and automatic** when a file is selected:
- Reduces clicks and friction
- Provides instant visual feedback
- Matches modern app expectations

### 3. **Component Architecture**
Components are **modular and reusable**:
- Separate hooks for different concerns
- Clean separation of UI and logic
- Easy to test and maintain

## Usage Instructions

1. **Access Profile**: Navigate to `/profile` page
2. **Upload Image**: Click on profile picture or drag image file
3. **Edit Profile**: Click "Edit Profile" button to modify details
4. **Save Changes**: Click "Save Changes" or "Cancel" to exit edit mode

## File Structure

The implementation is production-ready with proper error handling, loading states, and user feedback. All components follow your existing code patterns and styling conventions.
