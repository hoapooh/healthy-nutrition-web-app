# Order System Weight Integration Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully integrated weight functionality into the order system to maintain consistency with the updated cart and product features.

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Order Types Updated** (`src/types/order.ts`)

```typescript
export interface OrderItemPayment {
  productId: string;
  productName: string;
  quantity: number;
  pricePerUnit: number;
  productImageUrl?: string;
  weight?: number; // in grams - NEW
  pricePerKg?: number; // base price per kg - NEW
}
```

### 2. **Order Details Dialog Enhanced** (`src/features/client/order-history/ui/components/order-details-dialog.tsx`)

- Added weight utility import
- Updated order item display to show:
  - Product weight (when available)
  - Price context with weight information
  - Improved layout with weight details

**Features Added:**

- Weight display for each order item
- Price per unit shows weight context (e.g., "Price per unit: $15.00 (for 500g)")
- Conditional rendering - only shows weight if data is available

### 3. **Checkout Page Enhanced** (`src/app/(home)/checkout/page.tsx`)

- Added weight utility import
- Updated cart-to-order conversion to include weight data
- Enhanced order summary display with weight information

**Features Added:**

- Weight information preserved when creating orders
- Checkout summary shows weight for each item
- Maintains consistency with cart display

## 🔄 Data Flow Integration

### **Cart → Order Flow**

1. **Cart Items** contain weight and pricePerKg
2. **Checkout** converts cart items to order format, preserving weight data
3. **Order Creation** includes weight information in API payload
4. **Order History** displays weight information when viewing details

### **Weight Data Persistence**

- Weight information flows from product selection → cart → checkout → order
- Historical orders maintain weight information for accurate records
- Order details show exactly what was purchased (weight-specific)

## 🎨 UI Improvements

### **Order Details Dialog**

```tsx
// Before: Basic item info
<p>Quantity: {item.quantity}</p>
<p>Price per unit: {formatCurrency(item.pricePerUnit)}</p>

// After: Weight-aware display
<p>Quantity: {item.quantity}</p>
{item.weight && (
  <p>Weight: {formatWeight(item.weight)}</p>
)}
<p>
  Price per unit: {formatCurrency(item.pricePerUnit)}
  {item.weight && (
    <span> (for {formatWeight(item.weight)})</span>
  )}
</p>
```

### **Checkout Summary**

```tsx
// Enhanced display with weight context
<div className="space-y-1">
  <p>
    {formatCurrency(item.price)} × {item.quantity}
  </p>
  <p>Weight: {formatWeight(item.weight)}</p>
</div>
```

## 🔍 Backward Compatibility

### **Graceful Handling**

- Weight fields are optional in order types
- Conditional rendering prevents errors for old orders without weight data
- System works seamlessly with both old and new order data

### **Migration Path**

- New orders automatically include weight information
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## 🚀 Benefits

- **Clarity**: Order history shows specific product variants purchased

### **Business Value**

- **Accurate Records**: Complete order information for customer service
